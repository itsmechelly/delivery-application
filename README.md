Hi Rotem,

<br/>
First, it is important for me to say thank you for the opportunity.<br/>
I looked at the company's profile, Â and I totally want to join your team!<br/><br/>

I'm still on the time frame, but due to previous commitments I'm submitting at the last minute, <br/>I hope you will understand and will like my code. (:

Some Important Notes:

1. Spring WebFlux -<br/>
The project contains concurrent features, I think that the optimal project will be by using Spring WebFlux, but due to time limitations I decided to use Spring Boot.

2. Comments -<br/>
In addition, due to the time limit - I didn't add comments.<br/>
I believe in cleanCode that will be accessible for the team, just didn't have enough time.
<br/><br/>
BUT!<br/>
I include a lot of logs - in which you can understand the flow of the code easily.<br/>

3. HolidayAPI -<br/>
Since 'holidayapi' does not support the current year for free - I hardcoded data of last year - '2021'.

4. Gighub bucket4j -<br/>
Regarding business capacity, to make sure that the system supports 10 deliveries per day, I used Github's amazing library called bucket4j.

5. Geoapify -<br/>
To resolve the correct address I have used Geoapify.

6. Timeslots limitation -<br/>
I have added a new column to Timeslot entity 'timeslotLimit'.

7. Concurrent Requests Validation -<br/>
Well, Spring is Singleton by default, BUT not a thread safe.<br/>
To handle concurrent requests I used @Version annotation in the Delivery entity.<br/><br/>
PLUS - I added ThreadPoolTaskExecutor, to setMaxPoolSize, I know I didn't have to add it, because I have already handled the 10 daily requests per day, but was thinking it would be nice to show you I can do it. (:<br/><br/>
PLUS - I have already used @Transactional annotation for other reasons, but it gives extra support for thread safe running.

<br/><br/>
Hope to hear from you soon,<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
